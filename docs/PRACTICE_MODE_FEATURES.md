# CoPywork Practice Mode Syntax Highlighting

## Overview

The practice mode syntax highlighting feature transforms the typing practice experience by providing visual feedback that adapts to your typing progress. This creates an immersive environment where the code comes to life as you type it correctly.

## Visual Behavior

### Edit Mode
- **Full Syntax Highlighting**: All Python syntax elements are displayed in their full, vibrant colors
- **Real-time Updates**: Colors update as you modify the code
- **Standard VSCode Theme**: Uses the configured theme colors at full saturation

### Practice Mode
- **Comprehensive Washed-out Text**: ALL untyped text appears in muted, low-contrast colors (30% opacity), including:
  - Syntax-highlighted elements (keywords, strings, comments, etc.)
  - Variable names and identifiers
  - Non-highlighted text and whitespace
  - Function parameters and local variables
- **Progressive Restoration**: As you type correctly, the normal colors are restored (syntax or default)
- **Error Highlighting**: Incorrect typing immediately shows bright red (#FF0000)
- **Smart Backspace Behavior**: Deleting text returns only that character to the washed-out state, preserving all other typing progress

## Color Algorithm

The washed-out effect uses an intelligent color blending algorithm:

```python
# Blend syntax color with background
washed_color = original_color * 0.3 + background_color * 0.7
```

This creates a subtle, readable preview while maintaining the syntax structure.

## Examples

### Before Typing (Practice Mode)
```python
# All text appears washed out
def fibonacci(n):           # Muted blue for 'def', muted yellow for function name
    """Generate sequence"""  # Muted green for docstring
    if n <= 0:              # Muted purple for 'if', muted orange for number
        return []           # Muted purple for 'return'
```

### During Typing (Correct)
```python
# Typed text restores to normal colors
def fibonacci(n):           # 'def' in bright blue, 'fibonacci' in bright yellow
    """Generate sequence"""  # Remaining text still washed out
    if n <= 0:              # Still washed out
        return []           # Still washed out
```

### During Typing (Incorrect)
```python
# Incorrect characters show bright red
dex fibonacci(n):           # 'x' appears in bright red
    """Generate sequence"""  # Remaining text still washed out
```

## Technical Features

### Intelligent Tag Management
- **Separate Tag Sets**: Normal and washed-out syntax highlighting use different tag sets
- **Position-Specific Updates**: Only the character being typed is updated, not the entire document
- **Efficient Performance**: Minimal impact on typing responsiveness

### Color Restoration Logic
1. **Tokenization**: Uses Pygments to identify the syntax element at the cursor position
2. **Scope Mapping**: Maps Pygments tokens to VSCode theme scopes
3. **Tag Replacement**: Removes washed-out tag and applies normal syntax tag
4. **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation if tokenization fails

### Error State Management
- **Immediate Feedback**: Incorrect typing instantly removes syntax highlighting
- **Bright Red Override**: Uses #FF0000 for maximum visibility
- **Smart Restoration**: Backspacing correctly restores the appropriate syntax color for only the affected character

### Comprehensive Text Coverage (Enhanced)
- **Universal Washing**: ALL text receives washed-out treatment, not just syntax-highlighted elements
- **Default Text Handling**: Variable names, identifiers, and plain text are properly managed
- **Dual Tag System**: Separate handling for syntax-specific and default text colors
- **Consistent Experience**: No text is left at normal brightness in practice mode

### Backspace Behavior (Fixed)
- **Position-Specific**: Only the character being deleted is affected
- **Progress Preservation**: All other typing progress remains intact
- **Efficient Updates**: No full document re-highlighting on backspace
- **Consistent Experience**: Maintains the same visual feedback as forward typing

## User Experience Benefits

### Enhanced Learning
- **Visual Progress**: See your typing progress through color restoration
- **Syntax Awareness**: Learn Python syntax through visual reinforcement
- **Error Recognition**: Immediate feedback on typing mistakes

### Improved Focus
- **Reduced Distraction**: Washed-out text keeps focus on current typing position
- **Clear Targets**: Bright, untyped text shows what to type next
- **Progress Visualization**: Completed sections stand out clearly

### Motivation
- **Satisfying Feedback**: Watching code come to life as you type correctly
- **Clear Goals**: Visual distinction between completed and remaining work
- **Achievement Sense**: Full-color code represents successful completion

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `coPywork.py`: Main application with practice mode integration
- `syntax_highlighter.py`: Enhanced with washed-out color support
- `theme_loader.py`: VSCode theme parsing (unchanged)

### New Methods Added
- `highlight_text_practice_mode()`: Apply washed-out highlighting to ALL text
- `_apply_default_washed_color()`: Apply default washed color to entire document
- `restore_normal_color_at_position()`: Restore syntax or default color for correct typing
- `apply_incorrect_color_at_position()`: Clear all highlighting for errors
- `restore_washed_color_at_position()`: Restore washed-out color for backspaced characters
- `_apply_washed_color_at_position()`: Apply washed-out color to specific position
- `_apply_default_washed_at_position()`: Apply default washed color to specific position
- `_apply_default_normal_at_position()`: Apply default normal color to specific position
- `_wash_out_color()`: Color blending algorithm
- `configure_tag()`: Enhanced with washed-out support

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Tag Creation**: Tags are created only when needed
- **Position-Specific Updates**: Only affected characters are re-highlighted
- **Efficient Color Calculation**: RGB blending computed once per color

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage includes:
- Color blending algorithm accuracy
- Tag management for normal/washed modes
- Position-specific highlighting updates
- Integration with existing typing mechanics

Run tests with:
```bash
python test_practice_mode_highlighting.py
```

## Demo

Try the practice mode with the included demo file:
```bash
python coPywork.py demo_practice_mode.py
```

Then:
1. Press Ctrl+M to enter Practice mode
2. Notice how all syntax highlighting becomes washed out
3. Start typing to see colors restore as you type correctly
4. Try typing incorrectly to see bright red feedback
5. Use backspace to see text return to washed-out state

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **Customizable Wash Factor**: Allow users to adjust the washed-out intensity
- **Animation Effects**: Smooth color transitions during typing
- **Multiple Error Colors**: Different colors for different types of errors
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress bars or completion percentages
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for correct/incorrect typing

## Conclusion

The practice mode syntax highlighting feature transforms CoPywork from a simple typing trainer into an immersive coding practice environment. By providing immediate visual feedback and progressive color restoration, it creates an engaging and educational experience that helps users learn both typing skills and Python syntax simultaneously.
